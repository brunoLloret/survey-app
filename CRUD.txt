save draft survey
    saveDraftSurvey -> post /surveys/:id
    it is the same path, same action,
    it depends on an if: if isPublished, then it's not a draft

getAllDrafts    /surveys/drafts
getDraftById /surveys/draft/:id

2 Here I think the survey/draft path is clearer but perhaps
unnecesary. Do paths reflect always data dependency or do
I have to just declare a path as a namespace?
