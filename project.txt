Overview
Your goal today is to build a simple full-stack application (that means frontend AND backend AND database).

You will be using ExpressJS to serve static HTML forms and handle submissions, and you may use Claude / ChatGPT to ask questions, but NOT to copy code. You cannot use Cursor or Github Copilot or any form of AI code-writer. Type every character of code yourself -- don’t even copy from the docs. You will be surprised how much muscle memory matters.

A survey app is exactly what it sounds like: an app to create surveys and collect anonymous survey results. It needs to:
Create New Surveys
Show all Past Surveys, with links to “survey results” and “take this survey” screens,
Allow a user to take a survey, submit the survey, and see “success, thank you for submitting”.

YOU DO NOT NEED AUTHENTICATION FOR THIS APP.

A survey app covers a full stack application. Focus on getting the underlying functionality in place, and then clean up the UI/UX with Daisy/Tailwind. 
Core Concepts
CRUD
Data Modelling
ORMs
HTML + CSS + Forms
Features
Your Survey App should have the following, built with simple HTML templates OR React, served via Express.

NOTE: You may swap to React at any time; no need to wait until you’ve built the whole thing with HTML Templates. I recommend swapping to React if you feel too confused with HTML templates.

Be able to respond (anonymously) to a survey (series of questions) and have your answer recorded
All survey answers are freeform text responses

Survey Results
View a list of responses

Bonus:
Allow multiple survey block types (multiple choice, range, date)
Aggregate results in the Survey Results View
When a question is answered, minimize the survey block



******

1. Welcome page

2. Existing surveys
-> Take any survey
    -> Answer questions
        -> POST db surveyId -> questions[i]
    -> Submit survey
    
    -> Options: See statistics / Go back to main / Go back to Surveys

3. Survey Creator

-> Create survey
    -> Add title
    -> Add multiple survey blocks (questions)
    
-> Create survey once blocks are done
    -> Store it in db 
    -> IsPublished true
    -> Generate a link to take the survey
    -> Options: Take the survey / go back to Create survey / Go back to main

-> Edit a survey
    -> Title?
    -> Block? -> Display number/section and title of block/question Edit/delete
-> Delete a survey
    -> Delete all? Confirmation


Steps:
1. Generate Prisma Schema
2. Generate fake data and seed the schema
3. Hard-code Welcome page, Existing surveys, Create survey, Edit surveys.
    Are they any reusable components?
    Perhaps the type of blocks:
        text
        multiple choice
        accordeon
        check-box
4. Generate front-end structure: links and pages
5. First operation front-end / back-end: getAllSurveys
5b. Clone the app for future variations: useContext, redux, etc
6. Define where to handle the diverse states
7. Define all the other actions with the backend, write service
